    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    
    <ul>
        <li><p>2 cups all-purpose flour</p></li>
        <li><p>3 tablespoons white sugar</p></li>
        <li><p>4 teaspoons baking powder</p></li>
        <li><p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p></li>
        <li><p>1 egg</p></li>
        <li><p>1 cup milk</p></li>
        <li><p>1/4 cup vegetable oil</p></li>
        <li><p>1 cup blueberries</p></li>
        <li><p>1/2 cup chopped walnuts</p></li> 
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Beat the egg, milk, and oil together in a separate bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; pour the egg mixture into the well, and stir until the flour mixture is just moistened. Be sure to not over-mix. Fold the blueberries and walnuts into the batter. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups to about 3/4 full.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.</p></li>
